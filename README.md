# Data Aggregator API Documentation

## Overview

The Data Aggregator API is a crucial component of our Trust and Verification System, serving as the aggregation layer. It facilitates the collection of data from various sources on the web, preparing it for further processing, hashing, and storage in the Data Bank on the verification layer.

## 1. Introduction

The Data Aggregator API is designed to aggregate data from predefined sources on the web. It acts as an intermediary layer between the internet layer (web) and the verification layer (Data Bank). The collected data is then processed and sent securely to the Data Bank for hashing and storage.

## 2. Features

### 2.1 Web Data Aggregation

The API aggregates data from specified sources on the web, ensuring a comprehensive collection of information for further processing.

### 2.2 Data Processing

Collected data undergoes processing to extract relevant information, preparing it for secure storage on the verification layer.

### 2.3 Integration with Data Bank

The API seamlessly integrates with the Data Bank contract, sending processed data for secure hashing and storage on the Merkle tree.

## 3. API Endpoints

### 3.1 `/data`

- **Method:** GET
- **Description:** Welcome message confirming successful API access.

### 3.2 `/news`

- **Method:** GET
- **Description:** Retrieve aggregated news articles from predefined sources.

### 3.3 `/news/:newspaperId`

- **Method:** GET
- **Description:** Retrieve aggregated news articles specific to a given newspaper.

## 4. Integration with Data Bank

The Data Aggregator API collaborates with the Data Bank contract in the following manner:

1. Data is collected from the web using the API endpoints.
2. The collected data is processed to extract relevant information.
3. Processed data is sent securely to the Data Bank contract for hashing and storage on the Merkle tree.

## 5. Usage Examples

### 5.1 Fetching News Articles

# ```bash
curl http://your-api-url/news

#### 5.2 Fetching News Articles by Newspaper
curl http://your-api-url/news/moneylion

6. Security Considerations
Implement secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) to protect data during transit.

Regularly update and patch dependencies to address potential security vulnerabilities.

Enforce proper access controls to restrict unauthorized access to sensitive endpoints.

Monitor API usage patterns to detect and mitigate potential security threats.

7. Contributing
